# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-SQL

# Project Objecive 
The objective of this project was to create a SQL-based analytical solution for an e-commerce dataset. Data was randomly generated by me for the purpose of generating insights  into sales performance, customer behaviour and product trends which will in-turn enable data-driven decisions for a company
